# Project Overview

## Modern Java Features and Open Source Libraries

### Modern Java Features

1. **Java 8 Streams and Lambda Expressions**:
    - Used for efficient and concise data processing and transformation.

2. **CompletableFuture and ExecutorService**:
    - For asynchronous and parallel processing, which is crucial for handling large data sets efficiently.

3. **Try-with-resources**:
    - For automatic resource management, ensuring that resources like files are properly closed after use.

### Open Source Libraries

1.  **Log4j**:
    - A logging framework for logging application messages. It is highly configurable and supports various logging levels, making it easy to manage and monitor application logs.

## Usage in the Project

### Java 8 Features: Streams and Lambda Expressions

**ConfigurationLoader.java**
- Streams and lambda expressions are used for efficient processing and transformation of configuration data.
- Example:
  ```java
  List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(filePath));
  for (String line : lines.stream().skip(1).collect(Collectors.toList())) { // Processing logic
  }

**Modern Java Features: CompletableFuture and ExecutorService**

**DataTranslator.java**
- ExecutorService is used for parallel processing of data chunks.
- Example:
  ```java
  ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors());
  List<Future<List<DataRow>>> futures = new ArrayList<>();

**Try-with-resources for Automatic Resource Management**

**DataFileWriter.java**
- Used for managing file resources efficiently.
- Example:try (BufferedWriter writer = Files.newBufferedWriter(outputPath)) { // Try-with-resources for automatic resource management
    // Writing logic
}

**Class Design and Encapsulation**
- DataTranslator: Manages the overall translation process, including file listing and initiating chunk processing.
- DataFileProcessor: Processes individual chunks of data.
- DataFileWriter: Writes processed data to output files.
- ConfigurationLoader: Loads column and identifier mappings from configuration files.
- DataRow: Represents a row of processed data.
- ColumnMapping and IdentifierMapping: Represent mapping configurations.

**Good Development Practices**

**Logging and Exception Handling**
- LoggerUtil: A utility class used for logging messages, both informational and error.
- Try-Catch Blocks: Wrapped critical code sections with try-catch blocks to handle and log exceptions gracefully.
- Example: 
    ```java
        LoggerUtil.java
        - LoggerUtil provides methods for logging information and errors.
        - Example:
  
    public static void logError(String message, Throwable t) {
        if (t != null) {
            logger.error(message, t);
        } else {
            logger.error(message);
        }
    }

**Maintainability of the Solution**

**Documentation and Readability**
- Javadoc Comments: Detailed comments explaining the purpose and functionality of classes and methods.
- Inline Comments: Comments explaining complex logic within methods.
- Modular Design: Separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain and extend the code.
- Example: 
    ```java
      DataFileProcessor.java
      - Detailed comments and Javadoc for each method.
      - Example:/**
  
    * Processes the chunk of data.
    *
    * @return a list of processed data rows
    * @throws Exception if an error occurs during processing
      */
      @Override
      public List<DataRow> call() throws Exception {
      // Processing logic
      }
  
**Real-life Usage of the Solution with Big Amounts of Data**

**Performance and Scalability**
- Chunk Processing: The solution processes data in chunks to handle large files efficiently.
- Multithreading: Uses an ExecutorService to process multiple chunks in parallel, improving performance and scalability.
  - Example: 
    ```java
      Chunk Processing and Multithreading
      - Chunk processing and multithreading implementation in DataTranslator.java.
      - Example:ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors());
    
    for (int i = 0; i < lines.size(); i += chunkSize) {
      // Chunk processing logic
      }
